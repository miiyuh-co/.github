# 🌱 miiyuh.co (might change to studio miiyuh)

hi. this is a small space where i work on things that live somewhere between code and creativity.

you’ll find bits of:
- 💻 web dev  
- 🎨 digital art + design  
- 📷 photography  
- 🧰 small software tools  
- 🧪 unfinished experiments  

it’s mostly just me [@miiyuh](https://github.com/miiyuh), making things and seeing where they go.
