# miiyuh.co (might change to studio miiyuh)

hi. this is a small space where i work on things that live somewhere between code and creativity.

you’ll find bits of:
- web dev
- digital art + design
- photography
- small software tools
- unfinished experiments

it’s mostly just me [@miiyuh](https://github.com/miiyuh), making things and seeing where they go.
